## 🌐 3. Environmental Factors (Research Simulation)

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| Network Load | Frame drop probability modeling |
| Camera Count | Buffer scaling behavior |
| Client Density | Routing complexity |
| Latency Variability | Forwarding adaptation |
| Metadata Quality | Routing accuracy |

## 🛡️ 4. Reliability Principles
Aligned with the Systemheda reliability doctrine:

- **R1 – Modularity:** Replaceable relay modules  
- **R2 – Predictability:** Deterministic routing behavior  
- **R3 – Observability:** Metadata‑rich relay logs  
- **R4 – Repairability:** Isolated buffering layers  
- **R5 – Redundancy:** Multi‑path forwarding  
- **R6 – Scalability:** Multi‑camera, multi‑client expansion
